## Introduction

A decentralised platform for buying and selling and auctioning art.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Purpose

A market place for art where artists and art lovers can trade directly in a middle man free environment and in a community that supports artists and creators. This is a decentralised e-commerce application that uses unique properties of public blockchains to establish
provenance of artwork.

By establishing provenance certificates of authenticity can be issued to artists and collectors. This then allows our key objective
of being able to pay residuals to artists and galleries on subsequent sales of artworks.
